# AI Apps Using GPT-4o Model

This repository contains a collection of AI applications built using the GPT-4o
model, which is capable of reading images, identifying text and objects within
them, and performing actions based on prompts.

## Features

- **Image Recognition**: The GPT-4o model can analyze images and identify
  various objects, text, and other elements present within them.
- **Text Extraction**: The model can extract and recognize text from images,
  making it useful for tasks like OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
- **Prompt-based Actions**: Users can provide prompts or instructions, and the
  model will perform the requested actions based on the image and text analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-apps-gpt-4o.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. update .env file with OpenAI API KEY: `OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>`
3. Run the desired application: `node <file_name>`

## Applications

This repository includes the following AI applications:

- **Image Captioning**: Generates descriptive captions for input images.
- **Text Recognition**: Extracts and recognizes text from images.
- **Object Detection**: Identifies and locates objects within images.
- **Document Processing**: Processes and extracts information from documents
  (e.g., invoices, receipts).
- **Visual Question Answering**: Answers questions based on the content of an
  image.
